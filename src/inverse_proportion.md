# Inverse Proportion

Inverse proportion occurs when one quantity increases while the other **decreases**. If you double one, the other is halved.

### The Mathematical Formula
The relationship is expressed as:
$$y = \frac{k}{x} \quad \text{or} \quad xy = k$$



### Key Characteristics
1. The product $x \times y$ is always constant ($k$).
2. The graph is a **curve (hyperbola)** that never touches the axes.

### Example: Speed and Time
If it takes 4 hours to travel a distance at 60 mph, how long will it take at 80 mph?
1. Find $k$: $60 \times 4 = 240$ (The total distance).
2. Apply to new value: $t = \frac{240}{80} = 3$.
**Answer:** 3 hours.
