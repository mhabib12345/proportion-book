**Step 1: Identify the type.** More cookies require more flour, so this is **Direct Proportion**.
$$y = kx$$

**Step 2: Find the constant ($k$).**
Let $y$ be flour and $x$ be cookies.
$$k = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{12}{30} = 0.4 \text{ cups per cookie}$$

**Step 3: Solve for 75 cookies.**
$$y = 0.4 \times 75 = 30$$
**Answer:** 30 cups of flour.

## Problem 2: The Construction Crew (Inverse)
It takes 6 workers 10 days to build a small shed. If the owner wants the shed finished in only 4 days, how many workers are needed in total?

**Step 1: Identify the type.** To finish in *less* time, you need *more* workers. This is **Inverse Proportion**.
$$xy = k$$

**Step 2: Find the constant ($k$).**
Let $x$ be workers and $y$ be days.
$$k = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ (total man-days required)}$$

**Step 3: Solve for 4 days.**
$$x \times 4 = 60$$
$$x = \frac{60}{4} = 15$$
**Answer:** 15 workers are needed.

## Problem 3: Fuel Consumption (Direct)
A car travels 150 miles on 5 gallons of gas. How far can it travel on a full tank of 14 gallons?



<details>
<summary><b>Click to see Solution</b></summary>

**Step 1: Find the constant.**
$$k = \frac{150}{5} = 30 \text{ miles per gallon}$$

**Step 2: Calculate for 14 gallons.**
$$d = 30 \times 14 = 420$$
**Answer:** 420 miles.

## Problem 4: Pumping a Tank (Inverse)
Three identical pumps can empty a water tank in 8 hours. How long would it take if 2 more pumps were added?



<details>
<summary><b>Click to see Solution</b></summary>

**Step 1: Note the total pumps.**
Starting pumps = 3. New pumps = $3 + 2 = 5$.

**Step 2: Find the constant ($k$).**
$$k = 3 \text{ pumps} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 24$$

**Step 3: Solve for 5 pumps.**
$$5 \times t = 24$$
$$t = \frac{24}{5} = 4.8 \text{ hours}$$
**Answer:** 4.8 hours (or 4 hours and 48 minutes).
