# Direct Proportion

Direct proportion occurs when two quantities increase or decrease at the **same rate**. If you double one, the other doubles as well.

### The Mathematical Formula
The relationship is expressed as:
$$y = kx$$

Where:
* $y$ and $x$ are the variables.
* $k$ is the **constant of proportionality**.



### Key Characteristics
1. The ratio $\frac{y}{x}$ is always constant ($k$).
2. The graph is always a **straight line passing through the origin (0,0)**.

### Example
If 5 apples cost $10, how much do 8 apples cost?
1. Find $k$: $\frac{10}{5} = 2$. (Each apple costs $2).
2. Apply to new value: $y = 2 \times 8 = 16$.
**Answer:** $16.
