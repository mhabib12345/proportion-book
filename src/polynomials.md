# 🎭 Introduction to Polynomials

In our earlier chapters, we looked at simple relationships like $y = kx$. A **Polynomial** is simply a more complex version of these algebraic expressions.

The word comes from:
* **Poly-** (meaning many)
* **-nomial** (meaning terms)

## 1. What is a Polynomial?
A polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (like $x$), coefficients (numbers in front of $x$), and exponents (powers).



### The Golden Rules:
To be a polynomial, an expression **CANNOT** have:
1.  **Negative or fractional exponents** (No $x^{-2}$ or $x^{1/2}$).
2.  **Variables in the denominator** (No $1/x$).
3.  **Variables under a square root** (No $\sqrt{x}$).

## 2. Anatomy of a Polynomial
Let's look at $5x^3 - 2x + 7$:

* **Terms:** There are three terms ($5x^3$, $-2x$, and $7$).
* **Degree:** The highest exponent. Here, the degree is **3**.
* **Leading Coefficient:** The number attached to the highest power ($5$).
* **Constant:** The number without a variable ($7$).

## 3. Classifying Polynomials
We name polynomials based on how many terms they have and their degree.

### By Number of Terms:
* **Monomial:** 1 term (e.g., $4x^2$)
* **Binomial:** 2 terms (e.g., $3x + 5$)
* **Trinomial:** 3 terms (e.g., $x^2 - 4x + 4$)

### By Degree:
| Degree | Name | Example | Graph Shape |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | Constant | $7$ | Horizontal Line |
| 1 | Linear | $2x + 3$ | Straight Line |
| 2 | Quadratic | $x^2 - 5$ | Parabola (U-shape) |
| 3 | Cubic | $x^3$ | S-curve |

## 4. Polynomials in Standard Form
Standard form means writing the terms in order from the **highest exponent to the lowest.**

* **Messy:** $5 + 2x^3 - x$
* **Standard Form:** $2x^3 - x + 5$

## 5. Why do we care?
In the real world, polynomials model everything from the **trajectory of a basketball** (Quadratic) to the **growth of a savings account** with compound interest.

> **Connection to Proportion:** A linear polynomial with no constant ($y = mx$) is exactly what we studied in **Direct Proportion**! As the degree increases, the relationships just become more "curvy."
