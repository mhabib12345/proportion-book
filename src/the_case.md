# 🍕 Case Study: The Ultimate Pizza Party

Before we look at formulas, let’s look at a party. Imagine you are the lead organizer for the **End of Year Pizza Bash**. 

Two very different mathematical "laws" are happening at the same time. Let's break them down.

## 🟢 Scenario 1: The Grocery Bill
**The Rule:** Every pizza costs exactly $10.

| Pizzas Ordered ($x$) | Total Cost ($y$) | Math Logic ($y / x$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 Pizza | $10 | $10 / 1 = 10$ |
| 5 Pizzas | $50 | $50 / 5 = 10$ |
| 10 Pizzas | $100 | $100 / 10 = 10$ |

**The Discovery:** As the number of pizzas **increases**, the cost **increases**. If you buy twice as many pizzas, you pay twice as much money. 

> This is **Direct Proportion**. They move in the **same direction**.

## 🔴 Scenario 2: Sharing the Slices
**The Rule:** You have **one** giant box of 24 slices. 

| Number of Friends ($x$) | Slices per Person ($y$) | Math Logic ($x \times y$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2 Friends | 12 Slices | $2 \times 12 = 24$ |
| 4 Friends | 6 Slices | $4 \times 6 = 24$ |
| 8 Friends | 3 Slices | $8 \times 3 = 24$ |

**The Discovery:** As the number of friends **increases**, the amount of pizza each person gets **decreases**. If you double the number of friends, everyone gets half as much food.

> This is **Inverse Proportion**. They move in **opposite directions**.

## 💡 Summary Table

| Concept | Action | Movement | The "Constant" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direct** | Buying more items | Up & Up ⬆️⬆️ | The **Ratio** (Price per pizza) |
| **Inverse** | Sharing a fixed amount | Up & Down ⬆️⬇️ | The **Total** (Total slices available) |

## 🧠 Brain Teaser
Think about your journey to the pizza shop:
1. If you walk at a constant speed, does the **distance** you cover relate to **time** directly or inversely?
2. If the shop is a fixed distance away, does your **speed** relate to the **time** it takes to get there directly or inversely?
