# 📐 High School Geometry & Trigonometry

At the high school level, we focus on the relationships between angles and sides, as well as the properties of circles and coordinate planes.

## 1. Right Triangle Trigonometry
When dealing with right triangles, we use the ratios of the sides relative to an angle $\theta$.



**SOH CAH TOA:**
* **Sine:** $\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$
* **Cosine:** $\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$
* **Tangent:** $\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}}$

## 2. Laws for Non-Right Triangles
For any triangle with sides $a, b, c$ and opposite angles $A, B, C$:



### Law of Sines
The ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is constant.
$$\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}$$

### Law of Cosines
Useful for finding a missing side when you have two sides and the included angle (SAS).
$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(C)$$

## 3. Coordinate Geometry
Formulas used for points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ on a Cartesian plane.

* **Distance Formula:** $d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$
* **Midpoint Formula:** $M = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)$
* **Slope ($m$):** $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$

## 4. Circles & Conic Sections
Beyond area, we look at the equation of a circle and arc properties.



* **Equation of a Circle:** $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$ (where $(h, k)$ is the center).
* **Arc Length ($s$):** $s = r\theta$ (where $\theta$ is in radians).
* **Sector Area ($A$):** $A = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta$

## 5. Advanced Volume (Pyramids, Cones, Spheres)

| Shape | Volume ($V$) | Surface Area ($SA$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cone** | $V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h$ | $SA = \pi r^2 + \pi rl$ ($l$ = slant height) |
| **Pyramid** | $V = \frac{1}{3}Bh$ | $SA = B + \frac{1}{2}Pl$ ($P$ = perimeter of base) |
| **Sphere** | $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ | $SA = 4\pi r^2$ |

## 💡 The Calculus Connection
As you move toward Calculus, remember that **Volume** is the integral of **Area**, and **Area** is the integral of **Perimeter** (or circumference). 

Example: $\frac{d}{dr}(\text{Volume of Sphere}) = \frac{d}{dr}(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3) = 4\pi r^2$ (Surface Area!)
