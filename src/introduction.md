# Introduction

In mathematics, **proportion** describes the relationship between two quantities. When one value changes, how does the other react? 

Understanding whether a relationship is **direct** or **inverse** is essential for everything from cooking recipes to physics and economics.

In this book, we will break down:
* How to identify the type of proportion.
* How to calculate the constant of proportionality ($k$).
* Real-world applications for both types.
